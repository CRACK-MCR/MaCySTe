# As a dataset generator

MaCySTe can be used for generating believable data streams of protocols specific to the maritime context.

For instance it can generate:

- [NMEA sentences](./dataset-nmea.md) coming from the simulated Integrated Navigation System
- [RADAR image data](./dataset-radar.md) coming from the simulated radar antennas
- [Industrial Control System data](./dataset-modbus.md) coming from the simulated PLCs
