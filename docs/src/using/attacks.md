# As a target for attacks

MaCySTe reproduces the network infrastructure of a real bridge.

As a result, attacks can overhear and inject data as if they were acting in a real environment.

We provide two sample attacks:

1. [Targeted at the Integrated Navigation System](./attacks-ins.md)
2. [Targeted at the RADAR](./attacks-radar.md)
