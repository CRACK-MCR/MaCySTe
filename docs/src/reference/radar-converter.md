# RADAR signal generator

MaCySTe ships with a component named `radar-converter` that is in charge of simulating the behaviour of a RADAR antenna.

Currently, two types of antennas are supported, a Navico Broadband Radar (BR24) or an antenna trasmitting using ASTERIX CAT240 protocol.

The components takes as input the image matrix generated by Bridge Command and exported to a NATS Key-Value store.  
Then, according to the type of antenna, it encodes the image into network packets compliant to the protocol, and sends them through a multicast udp socket.
