# Contributing

Feel free to contribute to MaCySTe, add new features, fix some bugs, enable new usecases, go wild!

You can also contribute by asking for new usecases and improvements.

We suggest you to:
1. start by creating an issue to gather community feedback on your ideas
2. submit your code via a pull request (WIP pull requests are fine to gather early feedback)
3. engage in the review process

Most likely, Giacomo and Alessandro will review your PR and merge it after a brief discussion.
If you are ignored for a long time, please remind us by contacting at our email addresses indicated in the [introduction](../introduction.md)

As a guideline try to respect the following suggestions:

- integrate with each of your pull request also a corresponding documentation change so that this manual is always kept up-to-date with your updates
